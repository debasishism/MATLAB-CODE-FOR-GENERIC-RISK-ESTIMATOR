# GENERIC-RISK-ESTIMATOR
This project contains the MATLAB code for Un Decimated Wavelet Transform (UWT) based Generic Risk Estimator (GenRE) .
The algorithm first construct 13 sub-bands of Un Decimated Haar Wavelet Transfor (UWT) for level 1 to level 4.
This sub-band is then filtered and combined using GenRE algorithm.

Usage:
Area_Gen_Re.m: This is the main file. It contains various sub-modules/MATLAB functions:
1. decompose.m.
2. recompose.m.
3. Gen_RE.m
